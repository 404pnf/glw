title: 8个必看的UX设计图解
---

偶然在网上看到的一篇文章 这8个UX设计的图表 帮助我们视觉化的理解UX设计中各个要素之间的关系。特此收藏一下！<br>本文作者：<span style="color:#87ceeb">Andrew Maier</span><br><br><p>If you’re new to the field of user experience design, welcome! There’s <strong>plenty</strong>to see and do around here. And although many brilliant contributors have come before us, there’s actually not too much to catch up on—if you know where to look. Because pictures are worth so much, illustrated diagrams have served a critical role in our community.</p><br>Our community is filled with thought leaders, those among us that conjure up entirely new ways to look at difficult design problems. Unfortunately, their perspectives are only useful insomuch as they can be communicated to other practitioners; what good is a design process if it’s done in a vacuum? Diagrams are of great use because they cut to the heart of the matter, taking away the ambiguity of words and visually depicting abstract concepts.<br>In this post, I’ll share eight diagrams essential to the understanding of user experience design. If you’re extra curious, be sure to check out the accompanying links. Also, if you’re in search of something more comprehensive, check out <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?156">Luke Wroblewski’s ongoing catalog of UX Diagrams</a> over at his site.<br><h3><span></span><span></span></h3><br><ol><br>  <li><h4><a href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000029.php">The UX Honeycomb</a></h4><br><div><img src="http://uxbooth.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/honeycomb.png" alt=""></div><br>Despite its age (2004!), <a href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000029.php">the UX Honeycomb</a> by Peter Morville is still as relevant as ever. Unlike other diagrams featured in this list, however, the UX Honeycomb makes no claims with regards to process. Instead, it outlines the <em>subjective</em> considerations motivating our work. Peter explains:<br><blockquote>When I broadened my interest from IA to UX, I found the need for a new diagram to illustrate the facets of user experience—especially to help clients understand why they must move beyond usability—and so with a little help from my friends developed the user experience honeycomb.</blockquote><br><cite>Peter Morville</cite></li><br>  <li><br><h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://userexperienceproject.blogspot.com/2007/04/user-experience-wheel.html">The UX Wheel</a></h4><br><div><img src="http://uxbooth.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ux_wheel.png" alt=""></div><br>Even on first glance it’s fairly obvious that Magnus Revang, the creator of<a rel="nofollow" href="http://userexperienceproject.blogspot.com/2007/04/user-experience-wheel.html">The UX Wheel</a>, took a cue from Peter Morville’s UX Honeycomb. The significant difference here is that the UX Wheel <em>does</em> identify a design process, associating common deliverables with each subjective consideration. Magnus explains his diagram from the position of discovering a client’s value proposition outward:<br><blockquote>Value is what we want to accomplish—for customers and providers, positive user experience is a win-win situation—to achieve this we work backwards, starting and ending with search engine strategy, and going through and making a choice about each of the factors.</blockquote><br><cite>Magnus Revang</cite><br><br>I personally find Magnus’ work inspiring. It’s a common difficulty to tell which deliverable will help a client best. This diagram helps novice-to-intermediate practitioners simultaneously <em>place</em> their client’s malady and <em>recommend</em> the an appropriate design solution.</li><br>  <li><br><h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000228.php">The UX Treasure Map</a></h4><br><div><img src="http://uxbooth.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/map.png" alt=""></div><br>Another gem from Peter Morville, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://semanticstudios.com/publications/semantics/000228.php">the UX Treasure Map</a> is a concise representation of the common deliverables found in his design process. A basic knowledge of each deliverable—as well as their relationship to one another— helps any UX designer navigate their way inside of a project environment. Lest we find the treasure map prescriptive, though, Peter cautions us that simply knowing our deliverables isn’t enough:<br><blockquote>…for each project, we must strive for the optimal mix. Since our deliverables resist a taxonomy, asking questions may help derive their folksonomy. [Questions the UX Designer must ask themselves:] Audience. Who must you reach? Content. What is the message? Context. Where is the conversation? Process. When is the message? Problem. Why are you communicating?</blockquote><br><cite>Peter Morville</cite></li><br>  <li><br><h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements.pdf">The Elements of User Experience</a></h4><br><div><img src="http://uxbooth.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/elements.png" alt=""></div><br>Created by Jesse James Garrett, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements.pdf">The Elements of User Experience diagram</a>has had one of the most succinct descriptions of our entire field (as it applies to the web) for a long time. Jesse describes it thus:<br><blockquote>The Web was originally conceived as a hypertextual information space; but the development of increasingly sophisticated front- and back-end technologies has fostered its use as a remote software interface. This dual nature has led to much confusion, as user experience practitioners have attempted to adapt their terminology to cases beyond the scope of its original application. The goal of this document is to define some of these terms within their appropriate contexts, and to clarify the underlying relationships among these various elements.</blockquote><br><cite>Jesse James Garrett</cite></li><br>  <li><br><h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bryce/106972762/">The Importance of User Experience</a></h4><br><div><img src="http://uxbooth.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/importance.png" alt=""></div><br>Brought to us by Interaction Designer Bryce Glass, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bryce/106972762/">The Importance of User Experience</a> requires little explanation to the experienced UX professionals in the room. That’s because, as well-seasoned designers, we understand what experience design must be. If a user walks away from a website with a bad experience, it affects the entire organizations ability to meet their business goals. Sharing this diagram, and this understanding, is essential. As luck would have it, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.experiencedynamics.com/store/posters/importance-user-experience-poster">Glass’s diagram is available as a poster</a>—in case you want to spread the good word in a not–so–subtle fashion.</li><br>  <li><br><h4><a href="http://www.poetpainter.com/thoughts/article/ia-summit-2009-the-fundamentals-of-experience-design-">The Fundamentals of Experience Design</a></h4><br><div><img src="http://uxbooth.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/fundamentals.png" alt=""></div><br>Like many UXers, design consultant Stephen Anderson believes that the best solutions lie at the intersection of “People, their Activities, and the Context of those activities”—what he deems <a href="http://www.poetpainter.com/thoughts/article/ia-summit-2009-the-fundamentals-of-experience-design-">The Fundamentals of Experience Design</a>. Stephen’s diagram is almost a “thinking outloud” exercise, exploring the implications of this approach. Loaded with analytical thinking and insightful observations, Stephen’s diagram gives viewers a unique perspective on a commonly misunderstood design axiom.</li><br>  <li><br><h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://iainstitute.org/documents/tools/DesignProcess_color.pdf">Web Design Process Guide — 2003</a></h4><br><div><img src="http://uxbooth.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/dpc.png" alt=""></div><br>No web design process is perfect. But this diagram, co-created by various design departments at AOL and edited by Erin Malone, is a good first step. Any one who’s tried their hand at designing a sizable, content-driven website knows that the moving pieces of design aren’t that easy to articulate. This diagram helps piecemeal the process, laying the groundwork for a pragmatic, user-driven design endeavor.</li><br>  <li><br><h4><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.paznow.com/ucd/">User Centred Design</a></h4><br><div><img src="http://uxbooth.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ucd.png" alt=""></div><br>Finally, one of the freshest takes on illustrating user-centered design comes from Pascal Raabe, a multi-disciplinary designer hailing from the United Kingdom. His diagram, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.paznow.com/ucd/">User Centred Design</a>, explains the nuances inherent in this oft-misunderstood process. What’s great about Pascal’s diagram is that <strong>it marries familiar elements from other prominent UX diagrams</strong>(such as those by Jesse James Garrett, Magnus Revang, and Peter Morville). In addition, Pascal finds the time (and, frankly, the space) to explain how timeliness affects goal-driven design as well as various ways in which designers can assess common accessibility concerns. A brilliant piece.</li><br></ol><br>Tags - <a href="http://www.gaolewen.com/tag.php?tag=ux_design" rel="tag">ux design</a>
