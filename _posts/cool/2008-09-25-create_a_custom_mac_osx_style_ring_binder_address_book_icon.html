When you are going to start with designing an icon for Mac OSX there are many things you need to know. First of all you have to read the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AppleHIGuidelines/XHIGIcons/chapter_15_section_1.html">Apple Human Interface Guidelines</a>. It gives you a basic knowledge about the philosophy of Mac OSX User Interface design. The next thing to consider is actually what you want to create, so let's start making our own personalized icon for our Address Book app.<br><h3>Lighting Theory</h3><br>We start with a small theory about icon lighting. It's very simple to understand it. There are two sources of light - a sunlight as a strong light source and an environment reflection as a soft light source.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/theory.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 1</h3><br>Create a New Document that is 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels. To define a 512px by 512px rectangle (Leopard icon standard) add four guides (View &gt; New Guide).<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 2</h3><br>Create a New Layer and add a rounded rectangle (with a 20px diameter) as a shape layer. This will be the main shape of the book. I would like to have a red book, so I am going to choose a red color as the fill color. Let's call this layer "Book Cover."<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 3</h3><br>The books or the papers of Mac OSX icons have  a specific perspective, see the image below.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 4</h3><br>Take the Direct Selection Tool (A) and select two corner points (always two). Then align them to our guides (and then hide the guides). Copy the "Book Cover" layer one more time and rename it to "Paper." We are going to use this layer later, so hide it for now.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 5</h3><br>Double-click on the "Book Cover" to reveal Layer Style window and apply all the settings below. Don't forget to check Blend Clipped Layers as Group in the Blending Options.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step5_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step5.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 6</h3><br>Create a New Layer, press Command + Alt + G to change the layer to a Clipping Mask. Select the Pen Tool (P) and make a dark blue wide line on the left. Let's simply call it "Black Binding" because the dark blue looks like a black color.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 7</h3><br>Apply these settings on the "Black Binding."<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step7_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step7.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><br><h3>Step 8</h3><br>Add another two clipping masks to the book shape. These masks have to be under the &quot;Black Binding&quot; layer. Fill the first one with black. Next, go to Filter &gt; Noise &gt; Add Noise (apply an Amount of 75% and set the Distribution to Uniform). Also, change the Blending mode to Overlay and set the Opacity to 7%. On the second clipping mask apply the Note Paper Filter (with the Image Balance of 20, Graininess of 15, and Relief of 10). Change the Blending mode to Overlay and set the Opacity to 3%.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step8_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step8_2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step8.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 9</h3><br>Let's add some patterns to the "Black Binding." Create another two clipping masks, this time they have to be over the "Black Binding" layer, of course. Now we need to make a selection of the "Black Binding." So hold down Command and click on the vector mask of the "Black Binding." Fill the selection with a black color and apply the Graphic Pen filter with the settings below.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step9.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 10</h3><br>Click on Extract (Command + Alt + X), and extract about half of the black strips from the white color.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step10_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step10.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 11</h3><br>Change the Blending mode of this layer to Overlay and set the Opacity to 10%.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step11.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 12</h3><br>Now we are going to repeat something from previous steps. So select the second clipping mask, which we created in Step 9. Do the same steps like in Step 9, but without applying the Graphic Pen filter. We are going to use the Note Paper filter as like as in Step 8, with the same settings (Image Balance - 20, Graininess - 15, Relief - 10). And again, change the Blending mode to Overlay and this time, leave the Opacity on 100%.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step12.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 13</h3><br>The last thing we need to do on the "Black Binding" (and on the book cover) is to add some visible scratches. Create a new layer above all "Book Cover" clipping masks. Select the Brush Tool and a Starburst Brush (you can find it in Assorted Brushes).<br><br>Grab a black color, then make a selection of the "Black Binding" (Command + click on the vector mask), and click several times to the right border of the selection. At the end, create a new group, call it "Front Cover." Move all the layers we used to draw the book cover there.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step13.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 14</h3><br>So let's add a back to our book. Copy the "Front Cover" group, rename it to "Back Cover" and move it under the "Front Cover" group.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step14.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><br><h3>Step 15</h3><br>The "Back Cover" is almost similar to the "Front Cover." We need to hide only two layer effects. The first one is a Drop Shadow of the main book shape and the second one is a Bevel and Emboss of the "Black Binding" shape.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step15.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 16</h3><br>Now it's time to use the "Paper" layer from Step 4. So reveal this layer and grab the Direct Selection Tool. What we are going to do now is to scale down the "Paper" layer. But as you can see, we won't be using Transformation because we need to retain the rounded corners of the paper on the same radius as the book cover corners. If we scale with Transformation, the radius of the corners scales too. Always, select two corner points and move them a little bit closer to the next corner. At last, change the fill color to white.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step16.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 17</h3><br>Apply these settings to the "Paper" layer.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step17_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step17.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 18</h3><br>To create five papers, copy the Paper layer four times. After that, place them as shown below.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step18.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 19</h3><br>Create a New group, call it "Papers" and move all papers to this group. Place this group under the "Front Cover" group and over the "Back Cover" group.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step19.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 20</h3><br>Something still missing? Rings, of course. So let's do them. First, create an ellipse with the Ellipse Tool (U).<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step20.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><br><h3>Step 21</h3><br>Subtract another ellipse inside the first ellipse using the Ellipse Tool (U) in Subtract mode (-).<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step21.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 22</h3><br>Subtract the hidden part of the ring shape using the Pen Tool (P) in Subtract mode (-). Name this layer "Ring."<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step22.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 23</h3><br>Apply these settings on the "Ring."<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step23_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step23.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 24</h3><br>To create a small reflection of the red color, duplicate the "Ring," clear layer styles, and apply these properties.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step24_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step24.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 25</h3><br>Add a New layer, name it &quot;Ring shadow,&quot; then go to Layer &gt; Vector Mask &gt; Reveal All. Click on the vector mask of the &quot;Ring&quot; and copy the path to the &quot;Ring Shadow&quot; layer. Select this layer and use a soft black 100px Brush with 20% Opacity to add a black color to the ends of the &quot;Ring.&quot;<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step25.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 26</h3><br>Create a "Ring Eye" with the Ellipse Tool (U).<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step26.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 27</h3><br>Apply these layer settings on the "Ring Eye."<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step27_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step27.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 28</h3><br>Add a New Layer under the "Ring" and over the "Ring Eye." Create a selection of the "Black Binding." Take a black 50px Brush with 30% Opacity and paint a shadow under the "Ring."<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step28.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 29</h3><br>As you can see, it is necessary to fix the border of the "Ring." Create a New Layer over all the "Ring" Clipping Masks and fix it with a small black brush.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step29.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><br><h3>Step 30</h3><br>Create a New Group, name it "Ring Layers" and put all the "Ring" layers there. Then copy this group and move it up. The shadow under the second "Ring" should be a little different so rotate it a few degrees closer to the "Ring." To get five rings repeat this step three more times (without creating a New Group though).<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step30.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 31</h3><br>Select the Pen Tool (P) and make a shape of a fold, as in the picture below.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step31.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 32</h3><br>Apply the following properties on the "Fold."<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step32_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step32.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 33</h3><br>Duplicate the "Fold" four times.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step33.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 34</h3><br>Ok, let's add a shadow to the book. I'm not going to transform and blur the book shape, but instead I am using only the Brush Tool (B) and the Erase Tool (E). I think this way may be harder for you, but I hope if you do your best, the result will be more real. You can also play with the opacity of this layer, an important thing is that the shadow shouldn't be too strong and dark (a swhite background helps us with this).<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step34.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 35</h3><br>Now we've done the book. You can use it as replacement icon for many applications, but if we want to use it as Address Book, we should add one more detail. It's going to be an at-sign as in original icon. So choose you favorite font (I love Myriad Pro), set the font size to 250pt and type the character "@."<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step35.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><br><h3>Step 36</h3><br>Then rotate the at-sign about 10° to the left...<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step36.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 37</h3><br>...and apply these settings.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step37_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step37.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><h3>Step 38</h3><br>Copy the at-sign, move it a few pixels up, and a few pixels right. Clear the layer style, change the color to white, and apply the new settings. Don't forget to set the Opacity to 80%.<br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step38_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step38_2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br><div><img src="http://psdtuts.s3.amazonaws.com/197_Address_Book/step38.jpg" border="0" alt=""></div><br>Tags - <a href="http://www.gaolewen.com/tag.php?tag=tutorial" rel="tag">tutorial</a> , <a href="http://www.gaolewen.com/tag.php?tag=psd" rel="tag">psd</a> , <a href="http://www.gaolewen.com/tag.php?tag=icon" rel="tag">icon</a>
