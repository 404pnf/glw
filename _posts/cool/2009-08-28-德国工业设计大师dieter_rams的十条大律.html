title: 德国工业设计大师Dieter Rams的十条大律
---

<span style="color:#a0522d"><strong>1. 好设计是创新的  Good Design is innovative</strong><br><br>创新恒久远，山寨不流传<br><br>It does not copy existing product forms, nor does it produce any kind of novelty for the sake of it. The essence of innovation must be clearly seen in all functions of a product. The possibilities in this respect are by no means exhausted. Technological development keeps offering new chances for innovative solutions.</span><br><br><a href="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_1.png"><img src="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_1.png" alt="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" title="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" border="0"></a><br><br><br><span style="color:#a0522d"><strong>2. 好设计让产品有用 Good Design makes a product useful </strong><br><br>非可用勿扰<br><br>A product is bought in order to be used. It must serve a defined purpose – in both primary and additional functions. The most important task of design is to optimise the utility of a product.<br><br><a href="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_2.png"><img src="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_2.png" alt="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" title="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" border="0"></a><br><br><br><strong>3. 好设计有美感 Good Design is aesthetic </strong><br><br>美感很重要，懂得审美也很重要<br><br>The aesthetic quality of a product – and the fascination it inspires – is an integral part of the its utility. Without doubt, it is uncomfortable and tiring to have to put up with products that are confusing, that get on your nerves, that you are unable to relate to. However, it has always been a hard task to argue about aesthetic quality, for two reasons.<br>Firstly, it is difficult to talk about anything visual, since words have a different meaning for different people.<br>Secondly, aesthetic quality deals with details, subtle shades, harmony and the equilibrium of a whole variety of visual elements. A good eye is required, schooled by years and years of experience, in order to be able to draw the right conclusion.<br><br><a href="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_3.png"><img src="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_3.png" alt="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" title="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" border="0"></a><br><br><br><strong>4. 好设计有助于产品的传达 Good Design helps a product be understood </strong><br><br>让产品会说话<br><br>It clarifies the structure of the product. Better still, it can make the product talk. At best, it is self-explanatory and saves you the long, tedious perusal of the operating manual.<br><br><a href="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_4.png"><img src="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_4.png" alt="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" title="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" border="0"></a><br><br><strong><br>5. 好设计无障 Good Design is unobtrusive </strong><br><br>留点空间给用户<br><br>Products that satisfy this criterion are tools. They are neither decorative objects nor works of art. Their design should therefore be both neutral and restrained leaving room for the user’s self-expression.<br><br><a href="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_5.png"><img src="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_5.png" alt="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" title="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" border="0"></a><br><br><br><strong>6. 好设计是诚实的 Good Design is honest </strong><br><br>吹嘘，越吹越虚<br><br>An honestly-designed product must not claim features it does not have – being more innovative, more efficient, of higher value. It must not influence or manipulate buyers and users.<br><br><a href="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_6.png"><img src="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_6.png" alt="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" title="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" border="0"></a><br><br><br><strong>7. 好设计是持久的 Good Design is durable </strong><br><br>美感很重要，懂得审美也很重要<br><br>It is nothing trendy that might be out-of-date tomorrow. This is one of the major differences between well-designed products and trivial objects for a waste-producing society. Waste must no longer be tolerated.<br><br><a href="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_7.png"><img src="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_7.png" alt="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" title="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" border="0"></a><br><br><br><strong>8. 好设计追求细节 Good Design is thorough to the last detail </strong><br><br>成也细节，败也细节<br><br>Thoroughness and accuracy of design are synonymous with the product and its functions, as seen through the eyes of the user<br><br><a href="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_8.png"><img src="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_8.png" alt="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" title="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" border="0"></a><br><br><br><strong>9. 好设计关注环境 Good Design is concerned with environment </strong><br><br>拒绝垃圾，实体或像素的<br><br>Design must contribute towards a stable environment and a sensible use of raw materials. This means considering not only actual pollution, but also the visual pollution and destruction of our environment.<br><br><a href="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_9.png"><img src="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_9.png" alt="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" title="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" border="0"></a><br><br><strong><br>10. 好设计是极简的 Good Design is as little design as possible </strong><br><br>无，极<br><br>Back to purity, back to simplicity.</span><br><br><a href="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_10.png"><img src="http://i621.photobucket.com/albums/tt295/GlenGao/090828/090828_10.png" alt="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" title="点击在新窗口中浏览此图片" border="0"></a><br>Tags - <a href="http://www.gaolewen.com/tag.php?tag=dieterrams" rel="tag">dieterrams</a> , <a href="http://www.gaolewen.com/tag.php?tag=design" rel="tag">design</a>
